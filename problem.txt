Build a Students grading system with the following specs:

 

1) Start by building the system using the command line/ Sockets and JDBC in the backend.

 

2) Then, take the system a step further by making it a web app/ Rest API using traditional MVC Servlets/ JSPs (No Spring framework here).

 

3) Then, do the same thing using Spring MVC/Spring REST and you can keep the backend JDBC and/or use Spring JDBC tempate.  

 

System requirements:

- Students can login to their accounts

- Students can see their marks in different courses,and select a particular course to see their mark and the class avg/ median/ highest/lowest marks.

- Use MySql as a DB.

- You need to have a good understanding for Servlets/JSPs as they are required by Atypon (Usually there are questions about Servlets/JSPs and web apps  in Atypon interviews).

- Record a video (8 mins max) to explain your solution and explain how you progressed from an implementation to the next.
